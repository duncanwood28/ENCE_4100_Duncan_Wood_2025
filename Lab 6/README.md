# Lab 6: Chess Timer FSM

## Objective
The goal of this FSM verilog code is to act as a chess timer. The chess timer works by having two independent clock timers of equal time and speed, one for each of the two chess players. The timer starts out in a neutral or 'idle' state in which neither timer is active and doesn't start until one of the players presses the button to initiate their own timer. When one player's timer is active, the other one is paused. When one of the timers goes to zero, the game is over.
<br>
<br>
The first step in designing this chess timer, is writing the finite state machine (FSM) to represent the desired process of the system.

## FSM Derivation
Four possible states:
<br>
idle - Waiting for game to begin
<br>
Player A - Player A's timer is active, Player B's timer is paused.
<br>
Player B - Player B's timer is active, Player A's timer is paused.
<br>
Game Over - One of the timers reached zero.

The next step is designing the verilog module for the chess module FSM.
<br>
<br>

## Chess Timer FSM Module
As per usual the module starts out by declaring inputs, outputs, and local parameters for the function. This includes the clock and reset for the memory elements, inputs and output counters, and the FSM states as parameters.
<br>
<br>
Next the state register is written to decide whether to start over with reset or move on to the next state based on the logic.

<br>
The next-state logic is written based on the FSM designed earlier, switching between the 4 states in reaction to the 1-bit input w (buttons) and order of such.

<br>
Next the output logic is declared using a case statement. The case statement runs each of the counters based on the present state of the system.

## Top-Level Code
The inputs and outputs are assigned to FPGA elements (i.e. switches, LEDs, buttons, and 7-segment displays). Wires are also set up to connect said elements.

The chess timer fsm module and the 1 second counter are instantiated inside the top-level code.

Next the two n-bit counters are instanstiated inside the top-level code for the two timers.

And last, the display control for the 7-segment displays is instantiated to display the timers.
